# A Prework Study Guide to a New Skill (Coding)

## Description

I've always wanted to create a website using code. Yes, there are templates out there that can help you build a website quickly. I want to go to a website and know that I did that or that the team I collaborated with put this masterpiece together.
I created this study guide to have a foundation to refer back to when I need a refresher. Sometimes just returning to the basics will help us in our current situations. This study has taught me the basics of building a website, app, etc. With this knowledge, I'm absorbing a new skill that will set me apart from others.
